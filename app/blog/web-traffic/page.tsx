            Why Attorney Traffic Matters for Expert Witnesses
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            When attorneys visit your website, it signals interest in your
            qualifications, your experience, or your ability to contribute to a
            case. These visits aren&apos;t just numbers—they&apos;re potential
            opportunities to be retained as an expert witness. Understanding how
            attorneys find you, what pages they view, and whether they contact
            you is critical to growing your expert witness practice.

            witnesses, explain which metrics reveal attorney interest, and

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">
            What Is Web Traffic?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Web traffic refers to visits to your website. Each session
            represents someone—often an attorney or legal assistant—viewing your
            profile, CV, or service pages. Some may view one page and leave;
            others may browse multiple sections, read articles you&apos;ve
            written, or check your credentials.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            For expert witnesses, web traffic becomes valuable when it results
            in a contact form submission, email inquiry, or phone call about a
            potential case (mostly likely a phone call). That&apos;s the end
            goal—not just more visits, but{" "}
            <Link href="https://latinowebstudio.com/blog/more-cases">
              more case-related conversations
            </Link>
            .

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">
            Key Metrics That Show Attorney Interest
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Not all traffic is equal. Some visitors bounce after a few seconds.
            Others linger on your case history or practice areas. These are the
            web traffic metrics that matter most for expert witnesses:
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
            Sessions and Pageviews
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            A session is one visit to your site. Pageviews show how many pages
            that visitor explored. If attorneys are viewing multiple pages—like
            your CV, specialties, and case experience—it signals real interest.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
            Bounce Rate
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This is the percentage of users who visit just one page and then
            leave. A high bounce rate on your home or profile page might mean
            attorneys aren&apos;t finding the info they need or don&apos;t
            immediately{" "}

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
            Time on Page
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            If attorneys spend a full minute or more on your bio or expert
            services page, they&apos;re evaluating your fit for a case. Low time
            on page can be a red flag for unclear messaging or weak content.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
            Conversion Rate
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This is the percentage of visitors who take action—usually filling
            out a contact form or emailing you. For expert witnesses, this is
            the metric that matters most: it shows how well your site turns
            traffic into actual case inquiries.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">
            Why More Traffic Doesn&apos;t Always Mean More Cases
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">Picture two experts:</p>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Expert A:</strong> 500 visits/month, 12 attorney inquiries
            <br />
            <strong>Expert B:</strong> 5,000 visits/month, 10 attorney inquiries
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Expert B gets more traffic but fewer cases. That means the site
            might be attracting irrelevant visitors, or it fails to convince
            attorneys to reach out. Focus not just on volume, but relevance and
            conversions.

            Tools like Google Analytics use tracking scripts to record what
            attorneys do on your site—how they found you, which pages they
