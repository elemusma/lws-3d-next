            Why Fast-Loading Pages Make a Difference
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Page speed is the amount of time it takes for a web page to load its
            content. When pages load quickly, users stay longer, interact more,
            and are more likely to convert. For expert witnesses and
            professionals who rely on{" "}

            from attorneys, a slow website can be a deal-breaker. In
            legal-related searches, trust and efficiency go hand in hand, and a
            sluggish site sends the wrong message.

            The Relationship Between Page Speed, SEO, and User Behavior
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Search engines use hundreds of factors to determine where pages
            appear in search results. One of those is speed. Google has publicly
            stated that faster sites tend to rank higher because they offer a
            better user experience. When a visitor lands on a site, they expect
            to find what they need quickly. If it takes more than a few seconds
            to load, many will bounce. A slow-loading site can suggest poor
            quality or lack of professionalism—something to avoid especially
            when appealing to legal professionals.

            Ranking Signals and Core Web Vitals
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Google introduced Core Web Vitals to evaluate how users perceive the
            speed, responsiveness, and stability of a page. Metrics like Largest
            Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), and
            Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) are used as direct signals in{" "}

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-gray-800">
            Trust and User Behavior
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            First impressions count. If a site loads in under two seconds, users
            are more likely to stay and browse. A laggy interface can feel
            outdated or insecure, causing users to leave and look elsewhere.
            Trust is especially important for expert witnesses and consulting
            professionals whose services depend on credibility.

            LCP measures how long it takes for the largest visible element to
            load. INP tracks responsiveness to user interaction. CLS evaluates
            whether elements shift around as the page loads. Hitting the

            Time to First Byte (TTFB) measures how quickly your server responds.
            First Contentful Paint (FCP) shows how long until the first visual

            by JavaScript. Speed Index shows how fast content is visually
            displayed.

            Unoptimized Images
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Large image files slow down load times. Use modern formats like WebP
            or AVIF, compress files, and serve images at the correct dimensions.
            Plugins like EWWW Image Optimizer automate this process.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Common mistake: Uploading large, uncompressed images directly from a
            camera or stock site without resizing or converting.

          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Common mistake: Using too many plugins or stacking libraries that

          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            A slow host can delay everything. Ensure you use a reputable hosting

            Minify CSS and JS
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Remove whitespace and comments from code files. Use tools like

          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">

          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Content Delivery Networks serve your content from locations closer
            to your users. This reduces latency and increases load speed
            worldwide.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Common mistake: Not properly configuring CDN cache settings or
