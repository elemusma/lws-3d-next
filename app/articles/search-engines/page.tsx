            Search engines remain the primary method for navigating digital
            content. For experts in legal, financial, or engineering fields,
            understanding how search platforms operate—and how they are

            attorneys.

            Google continues to lead with over 90% global market share in
            desktop search, largely due to its unmatched infrastructure, data
            processing capabilities, and brand recognition. Yet, the search
            landscape is no longer static. Alternative platforms— prioritizing

            What Defines a Search Engine?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            A search engine is a software system designed to retrieve relevant
            information from a database based on user queries. While
            general-purpose engines like{" "}

            dominate, other types exist, including metasearch engines (e.g.,
            Dogpile), private engines (e.g., DuckDuckGo), and vertical engines
            focused on domains like academic research or code repositories.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Historically, search engines emerged in the early 1990s with tools
            like Archie and Excite. Over time, indexing algorithms,

            matching, and user feedback loops became more sophisticated, shaping

          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Crawling is the discovery phase where search bots scan the internet
