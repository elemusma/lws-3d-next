<p className="mb-4">Expert witnesses are essential to the legal system. Their insights help judges and juries make sense of complex technical or scientific evidence. But while the work of an expert plays out in courtrooms and depositions, there&apos;s an often-overlooked step that determines whether an expert even gets hired: <strong>how attorneys find and evaluate them.</strong></p>

<p className="mb-4">In a recent conversation with trial attorney <strong>Ian Grady</strong>, we explored the realities of <Link href="/articles/lawyers-experts-websites">how lawyers choose experts</Link>, what marketing approaches help (or hurt) credibility, why responsible AI use is unavoidable, and why collaboration is a powerful — yet underutilized — strategy for experts.</p>

<p className="mb-4">This blog post distills the discussion into practical takeaways for expert witnesses seeking to grow their practice and build trust with attorneys.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">How Attorneys Really Find Expert Witnesses</h2>

<p className="mb-4">Many experts assume that lawyers find them through polished websites, directories, or advertising. While these methods play a role, Ian was candid:</p>

<p className="mb-4"><em>&quot;The primary way I find expert witnesses is still <strong>word of mouth.</strong> If you do good work, attorneys will talk about you with their colleagues. That reputation spreads faster than anything you can pay for.&quot;</em></p>

              <CTAButtons />

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Word of Mouth First, Directories Second</h2>

<p className="mb-4">For most plaintiff&apos;s attorneys, recommendations from other lawyers remain the go-to source. Group chats, professional listservs like the <strong>Georgia Trial Lawyers Association (GTLA)</strong>, and informal networks provide quick and trusted referrals.</p>

<p className="mb-4">When cases involve unusual issues or specialized fields, attorneys may look to directories or online searches. But even then, they&apos;re often validating recommendations rather than cold-hiring an unfamiliar expert.</p>

<p className="mb-4"><strong>The Takeaway for Experts:</strong></p>
<p className="mb-4">- Reputation is currency. Delivering clear, professional, and credible work is the foundation of being hired again.<br/>- Be easy to work with. Attorneys value experts who communicate well, meet deadlines, and support their trial strategy.<br/>- Online visibility matters — but it supports, not replaces, reputation. A well-structured website and search visibility help lawyers find you outside your immediate network, especially when referrals fall short.</p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Marketing Without Losing Credibility</h2>

<p className="mb-4">Marketing is a delicate balance for expert witnesses. Unlike consumer-facing businesses, expert services are scrutinized under the lens of credibility and potential cross-examination.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Ian drew a sharp contrast between how law firms market to the public and how experts should approach attorneys.</p>

<p className="mb-4"><em>&quot;My law firm is called <strong>Pain Pros</strong>. Our marketing is bold — we wrap vehicles, use strong messaging, and it works. But would I drive my wrapped G-Wagon to trial? Absolutely not. The same applies to experts. You can market yourself, but you must always protect your credibility.&quot;</em></p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">The Fine Line Experts Walk</h2>

<p className="mb-4">- Advertising can be used against you. Defense attorneys (or opposing counsel) may try to paint an expert as biased or unprofessional if their marketing looks too flashy or one-sided.<br/>- B2B vs. B2C. Law firms market directly to injured clients (B2C), often with bold campaigns. <Link href="https://latinowebstudio.com/articles/marketing-strategies">Experts are marketing to attorneys (B2B)</Link>, where professionalism and trust are paramount.<br/>- Balance visibility and professionalism. Experts should showcase their qualifications, areas of expertise, and past case experience without exaggeration or gimmicks.</p>

<p className="mb-4"><strong>Practical Marketing Tips for Experts:</strong></p>
<p className="mb-4">- Maintain a professional website with clear bios, CVs, and case experience.<br/>- Publish articles or blog posts that highlight expertise in a factual, authoritative tone.<br/>- Avoid exaggerated claims or overly dramatic branding that could undermine objectivity.</p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Responsible AI Use: A Modern Necessity</h2>

<p className="mb-4">AI tools like ChatGPT are rapidly becoming part of professional workflows. But should experts use AI for writing reports, articles, or even testimony preparation? Ian believes the answer is yes — with responsibility.</p>

<p className="mb-4"><em>&quot;I think it&apos;s probably irresponsible <strong>not</strong> to use AI in some capacity. But you can&apos;t use it blindly. Review everything. Inputs matter. If it reads like AI, you&apos;re doing it wrong.&quot;</em></p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">The Risks of Blind AI Use</h2>

<p className="mb-4">- Hallucinations. AI can fabricate sources or citations if unchecked.<br/>- Telltale signs. Formulaic or unnatural language can reveal over-reliance on AI, hurting credibility.<br/>- Discovery. Opposing counsel may request draft materials. If those drafts show sloppy AI reliance, credibility can take a hit.</p>

<p className="mb-4"><strong>How Experts Can Use AI Responsibly:</strong></p>
<p className="mb-4">- Use AI as an editor or brainstorming partner, not a ghostwriter.<br/>- Always fact-check and revise output to reflect your professional voice.<br/>- Leverage AI for efficiency (grammar, outlines, brainstorming) but keep the substance grounded in your expertise.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Ian compared AI to having an &quot;always-on editor&quot; — a tool to sharpen ideas, not replace professional judgment.</p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Collaboration: The Missing Piece in Expert Marketing</h2>

<p className="mb-4">One of the most innovative ideas to come from the conversation was the power of <strong>collaboration.</strong> Ian emphasized that collaborations between experts and attorneys can build visibility, credibility, and mutual authority.</p>

<p className="mb-4"><em>&quot;Some of my best-performing content is when I collaborate with other lawyers. The algorithm loves it, and so does the audience. The same applies to experts — collaborating on blog posts or content adds credibility and benefits both sides.&quot;</em></p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Why Collaboration Works</h2>

<p className="mb-4">- Authority by association. Being featured on an attorney&apos;s website or podcast signals credibility to both search engines and prospective clients.<br/>- Mutual audience growth. Experts and attorneys both expand their reach by tapping into each other&apos;s professional networks.<br/>- SEO benefits. Backlinks from attorney websites can boost an expert&apos;s online visibility and search rankings.</p>

<p className="mb-4"><strong>Examples of Collaborations:</strong></p>
<p className="mb-4">- Co-author a blog post on a relevant case issue.<br/>- Record a joint video or podcast discussing a technical topic.<br/>- Guest post on each other&apos;s websites with backlinks to boost authority.</p>

<p className="mb-4">For experts, these partnerships create visibility without the risks of flashy advertising. They also demonstrate a proactive, value-driven approach — something attorneys respect.</p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">The Business Realities Attorneys Face</h2>

<p className="mb-4">Even if an expert has impeccable credentials, there&apos;s one practical factor attorneys must weigh: <strong>cost.</strong></p>

<p className="mb-4"><em>&quot;As much as I&apos;d love to hire the top expert every time, I can&apos;t. These fees come out of the client&apos;s case expenses. On smaller cases, we have to be frugal. That doesn&apos;t mean the cheaper expert is worse — but cost is always a consideration.&quot;</em></p>

<p className="mb-4"><strong>What This Means for Experts:</strong></p>
<p className="mb-4">- Flexibility helps. Offering scaled fees or alternative arrangements can make you more accessible to younger firms or smaller cases.<br/>- Experience builds pricing power. Over time, strong track records and referrals allow experts to raise their rates.<br/>- ROI matters. Attorneys must justify to clients that the cost of an expert will generate a better outcome.</p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Attorneys Don&apos;t All Think the Same</h2>

<p className="mb-4">A key insight Ian stressed was that <strong>not all attorneys think alike.</strong> Personality, practice area, and firm culture all shape how attorneys evaluate experts.</p>

<p className="mb-4"><em>&quot;Some lawyers are bold marketers like me. Others are more reserved. Some care most about cost, others about track record. There&apos;s no single mindset to crack. What unites us is wanting experts who deliver credible, useful, and professional work.&quot;</em></p>

<p className="mb-4"><strong>Implications for Experts:</strong></p>
<p className="mb-4">- Avoid one-size-fits-all marketing. Tailor outreach depending on whether you&apos;re speaking to plaintiff attorneys, defense attorneys, or specific practice areas.<br/>- Diversify your caseload. Working for both plaintiff and defense attorneys can prevent being painted as biased.<br/>- Let your work speak. In the end, recommendations, track record, and professionalism outweigh marketing gimmicks.</p>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Final Thoughts: A Delicate but Rewarding Balance</h2>

<p className="mb-4">The conversation with Ian underscored a few simple truths:</p>

<p className="mb-4">- Reputation and referrals remain king.<br/>- Marketing matters, but professionalism is non-negotiable.<br/>- AI should be embraced, but with caution and responsibility.<br/>- Collaboration is a powerful yet underused tool.<br/>- Cost and value drive attorney decisions.</p>

<p className="mb-4">For expert witnesses, the challenge is balancing visibility with credibility. It means using modern tools like AI and hiring the right <Link href="https://latinowebstudio.com/practice-areas/seo">SEO vendor</Link> without undermining professional objectivity. It means collaborating strategically to build authority. And above all, it means letting the quality of your work generate the referrals that remain the lifeblood of the profession.</p>

<p className="mb-4"><em>&quot;You can be the best expert in the world, but if no one knows you exist, you&apos;re not anyone&apos;s expert. Marketing matters — but your credibility and the quality of your work matter even more.&quot;</em></p>
